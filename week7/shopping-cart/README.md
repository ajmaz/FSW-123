# Project description

This shopping cart project is a UI in which you can browse thru randomly generated products usings random images, names, prices and boolean values 
(npm i @faker-js/faker). UI uses hooks to render items in the cart whether adding or deleting, it also adds up the total value of items placed in the cart.

## Components

# Header
In the header component I used react-bootstrap (npm i react-bootstrap) to make my Navbar section with search bar and a dropdown menu toggle, dropdown menu container, and drop down menu items.

# Filters
In the filters component a Form component was imported from react bootstrap to filter items displayed on home page. Each filter displays items accordingly by Price High/Low, by product rating, by shipping time, and whether a product is out-of-stock.

## Difficulties
Being I am fairly new to using react-bootstrap along with different npms, some documentation listed old syntax that had my app crash and have compyling errors. I  also had issues with the drop-down menu styling elements and could not get it to flow to the left to fit in-screen on media queries.
